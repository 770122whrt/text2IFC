Only known_facts.semantic_requirements and known_facts.semantic_review may change.
Copy every other field exactly, including original_request, geometry, status,
identities, storeys, dimensions, locations, decisions and fact sources. Do not
redesign, rename, invent values, reclassify an acknowledged defect or ask the user
to repeat clear facts. Extract from user turns, never from a candidate IFC/JSON.
Review all five semantic categories, using exact user turn IDs. specified requires
matching canonical records; not_specified means no request, never failed extraction.
Place every explicit material/property/Type/element appearance/template requirement
in the canonical array with its exact stable target and scope. Enumerate all targets
of a requested group; preserve explicit negatives. Global theme defaults do not
authorize element overrides or physical materials. No performance value without
an explicit request. If this cannot be corrected within the two allowed fields,
retain the unresolved status in semantic_review; the deterministic boundary stops.


Executable appearance grammar and scope (Design Brief 2.3)

semantic_requirements[].appearance is ONLY a whole-element numerical override:
color is an RGB array of three numbers in [0,1]; transparency is a number in [0,1].
The object must not be empty and cannot contain profile, frame_color, frame_profile,
glazing_transparency, colour words, or other component descriptions. Follow the
actual Schema exactly. These fields are executable requirements, not free text.

Keep the overall theme in known_facts.appearance.profile and preserve qualitative
style cues in its style_notes. Basic filling templates already provide distinct
frame/glazing/leaf styles. A request for dark thin frames and transparent glazing
compatible with the selected theme belongs to those template/theme choices; it
does NOT authorize one RGB or transparency override for the whole window/door.
Do not invent exact RGB/opacity numbers from qualitative style cues or ask about
already approved theme/template defaults. Keep physical material requirements
separate. Never clear a material because an appearance description is unsupported.

semantic_review.appearance specifically reviews whole-element numeric overrides.
With only an overall theme/default part-style request, use not_specified for this
category and keep the part-style description and explicit templates separately.
specified requires a legal, explicitly requested whole-element override in the
canonical array. If a genuinely explicit part-level customization cannot be
represented by the supported theme/template contract, preserve its text and use
the normal clarification/unsupported route instead of flattening component styles.
